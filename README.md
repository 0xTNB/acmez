Go ACME client implementation
=============================

Work in progress. Still under heavy development -- do not use. For now, use [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego).

However, most Go programs probably want [CertMagic](https://github.com/caddyserver/certmagic) instead of a low-level ACME library like this or lego.

Forked from lego, which was originally written for use in Caddy by Sebestian Erhart (xenolf).
